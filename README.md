# Interpretable Machine Learning for Customer Churn Prediction
## Project Overview：
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using interpretable machine learning models. The objective is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and provide recommendations for the most suitable model to address the customer churn problem. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of three models:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Generalized Additive Models (GAM)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook contains EDA steps to evaluate initial assumptions about the dataset, including:
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Summary statistics and distributions
* Feature selection and correlation analysis
* Visualizations of key features related to customer churn

## Model Implementations
1. Linear Regression Model (with ridge and lasso)
* Implementation with appropriate feature selection
* Assumptions checked and improved the model accordingly
* Evaluation using MSE
* Model interpretation and coefficient analysis
2. Logistic Regression Model
* Implementation with appropriate feature selection
* Assumptions checked and improved the model accordingly (weighted logistic model)
* Evaluation using confusion matrix and AUC-ROC
* Model interpretation and coefficient analysis
3. Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
* Implementation with appropriate feature selection
* Model fitting using spline functions
* Interpretation of non-linear relationships
4. Strengths and weaknesses discussed
5. Reccommendations
