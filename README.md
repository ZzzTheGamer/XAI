# Interpretable Machine Learning for Customer Churn Prediction
## Project Overviewï¼š
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using interpretable machine learning models. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of three models:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
The objective is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and provide recommendations for the most suitable model to address the customer churn problem.
