For example, replacing a medieval scenario like \"the knight fought the dragon\" with a futuristic battle between a robot and a drone or a cooking contest involving a chef leads to a complete transformation in scene, characters, and narrative. As a result, the semantic similarity between the base response and the perturbed outputs is significantly reduced.\n",
